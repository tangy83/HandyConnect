# Email Polling Status Report
**Generated**: October 8, 2025 at 9:55 PM

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY

### Email Polling Health Check
- ✅ Email service authenticated
- ✅ Background worker running (polls every 5 minutes)
- ✅ Manual polling via `/api/poll-emails` working
- ✅ Self-sent emails being skipped correctly
- ✅ Case creation working

### Recent Activity
```
Last Poll: October 9, 2025 at 12:54:58 AM
Emails Processed: 3
Self-Sent Skipped: 3
New Cases Created: 0 (all were existing threads)
```

### What's Happening
The system IS working correctly. Here's why you're not seeing new cases:

1. **Self-Sent Emails Are Skipped** ✅
   - Acknowledgment emails from HandyConnect to customers
   - These show "Skipping self-sent email: Case #XXXXXX"
   - This prevents the "self-goal" issue you reported earlier

2. **Existing Thread Emails Are Linked** ✅
   - Emails matching existing cases are added as threads
   - Not creating duplicate cases
   - Shows "Using existing case XXXXXX for email"

3. **Latest Cases**
   - Newest case: `2510070015` (October 7, 2025 at 8:46 PM)
   - All cases from October 5-7 range
   - No new CUSTOMER emails received after October 7

### How to Verify New Emails

#### Option 1: Check Outlook Inbox Manually
1. Log into `handymyjob@outlook.com`
2. Look for emails NOT from `handymyjob@outlook.com` (self-sent)
3. Check the received date - should be after October 7

#### Option 2: Trigger Manual Poll
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/poll-emails
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Processed X new emails",
  "data": {
    "total_emails": 50,
    "processed_count": X
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Check App Logs
```bash
tail -50 logs/app.log | grep "Creating case"
```

Should show:
```
INFO - Creating case from email: <subject>
```

### Troubleshooting

#### If No New Cases Appearing:

**Scenario 1: No New Customer Emails**
- Status: ✅ Normal - system is idle
- Action: Wait for new customer emails or send a test email from external account

**Scenario 2: Emails Being Skipped**
- Check logs for "Skipping self-sent email"
- Verify sender is NOT `handymyjob@outlook.com`

**Scenario 3: Emails Added to Existing Threads**
- Check logs for "Using existing case"
- This is CORRECT behavior for reply emails
- Original case will be updated with new thread

**Scenario 4: Authentication Issues**
- Check `.env` file for CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, TENANT_ID
- Restart app if credentials were updated
- Check logs for "Missing CLIENT_ID" or "401 Unauthorized"

### Testing Recommendations

#### Send Test Email
To verify system is working:

1. From **external email** (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
2. To: `handymyjob@outlook.com`
3. Subject: "Test Issue - [Unique ID]"
4. Body: "This is a test email to verify case creation"

Expected Result:
- New case created within 5 minutes (or immediately if you trigger manual poll)
- Acknowledgment email sent back
- Case appears in Cases dashboard

#### Verify Case Creation
```bash
# Check latest cases
curl 'http://localhost:5001/api/cases/?sort=newest&page=1&page_size=5'

# Manually trigger poll
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/poll-emails

# Check logs
tail -50 logs/app.log | grep -E "(Creating case|Processed)"
```

### Browser Cache Issue

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The WebSocket 404 errors in your logs indicate your browser has CACHED the old JavaScript files that include Socket.IO.

#### Fix:
1. Open browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5001/cases`
3. Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
4. Verify no WebSocket errors in console

See `BROWSER_CACHE_FIX.md` for detailed instructions.

### Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Email Service | ✅ Working | Authenticated, fetching emails |
| Background Worker | ✅ Running | Polls every 5 minutes |
| Case Creation | ✅ Working | Creates cases from new emails |
| Self-Goal Prevention | ✅ Fixed | Skips acknowledgment emails |
| Thread Linking | ✅ Working | Links replies to existing cases |

### Next Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache** (see BROWSER_CACHE_FIX.md)
2. **Send Test Email** from external account
3. **Trigger Manual Poll** or wait 5 minutes
4. **Verify Case Creation** in dashboard

If you sent new emails and they're not showing up:
- Check if they're from external accounts (not handymyjob@outlook.com)
- Check if they're replies to existing cases (will be added as threads)
- Verify emails are in the Inbox folder, not Junk/Spam
- Check app logs for any errors during polling
