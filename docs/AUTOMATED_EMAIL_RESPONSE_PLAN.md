## 🐛 Known Issues / Risks

| Issue | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| LLM API unavailability | No tone detection | Fallback to keyword analysis | TBD |
| Email delivery failure | Customer not notified | Retry logic + manual alert | TBD |
| Incorrect tone detection | Wrong template | Confidence threshold + manual review | TBD |
| High email volume | Rate limiting | Queue system + batching | TBD |

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ No customer data stored in acknowledgment logs beyond case ID
- ✅ Email content encrypted in transit (TLS)
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication for Microsoft Graph API
- ✅ PII handling compliant with data protection regulations
- ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse

---

## 📞 Support & Escalation

**For Issues During Implementation:**
- Check logs in `logs/app.log`
- Review acknowledgment service logs
- Verify Microsoft Graph API permissions
- Test with sample emails first

**Escalation Path:**
1. Check error logs
2. Verify configuration
3. Test email service independently
4. Review LLM service status
